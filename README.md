# Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) Design and Simulation

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a 12/8 Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) optimized for electric vehicle (EV) applications.

## Tools Used
- ANSYS Maxwell 2D
- RMxprt
- MATLAB/Simulink

## Project Objectives
- Design a 12/8 SRM rated at 100 kW and 8000 RPM.
- Simulate magnetic characteristics, torque generation, and efficiency.
- Analyze motor performance under EV operating conditions.

## Folder Structure
- `/Design_Files/` - ANSYS Maxwell and RMxprt design files.
- `/MATLAB_Simulations/` - Motor performance simulation scripts.
- `/Report/` - Final project report (optional).

## Authors
- Rohan Deore
